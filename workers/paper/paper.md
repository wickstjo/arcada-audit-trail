- Strictly refusing to use relatively sensitive data such as coordinates is extremely restrictive, and often greatly reduces the quality of experience of a service.

- Arguably, the underlying issue isn't that situational usage of sensitive data, but rather the storage of it
and potential future leaks.

- Building vast VPN tunnels in an attempt to secure IOT communication is messy and futile in many ways.

- To efficiently control the devices through APIs can also dangerous and complicated, particularly if you want to control and command a multitude of devices at once.

- Smart contracts offer a multi-dimensional solution for such an ordeal.
    - Built in encryption keys for authentication and masking data that enhances machine-to-machine communications.
    - Protected webhook like utility for sensitive orders.

- Majority of payload exchange should be machine-to-machine, and done via some async communication.
- Verification and such to be done via smart contract.
    - Something you are.
    - Something you say.

- Both IOTs and Edges could be centrally owned or deployed as with some kind of service model.
- The blockchain supports monetization.
- The communication protocol and storage models can be anything:
    - Kafka.
    - MQTT.
    - Whisper.
