### TODO
===============================================================================

ALL IOT ARE SUBSCRIBED TO SMART CONTRACT
IOT DEVICE SAVES DISTANCE TO CURRENT EDGE
WHEN NEW EDGE IS ADDED, SMART CONTRACT PULSES MESSAGE TO ALL IOT DEVICES
IF OLD DISTANCE IS LONGER THAN NEW DISTANCE, RECONNECT TO BETTER EDGE

TARGET UPDATE SMART CONTRACT DETAILS

TRANSITION TO USING PROPER ENCRYPTION KEYS (ETH?)
INTEGRATE ENCRYPTION (KECCAK?)
MOVE WORKERS OVER TO DOCKER COMPOSE

STORAGE CAN TRAIN A NEW ANOMALY MODEL WITH GATHERED DATA
AFTER TRAINING ONE, THE MESSAGE CAN BE SENT TO ALL CONNECTED DEVICES

ADD ANOMALY ALERT TO EDGE => IOT COMMUNICATION
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DETECT DEVICE CRASHES ON CONNECTED DEVICES

### DONE
===============================================================================

PIPE EDGE LOGS INTO STORAGE LOGS
CATEGORIZE EDGES AND STORAGES

GENERATE TOKEN FOR EVERY SUBMISSION
HAVE THE RECEIVING DEVICE RESPOND WITH THE TOKEN WHEN EVERYTHING WENT OK

REQUIRE IOT TO BE WHITELISTED FOR EDGE
REQUIRE EDGE TO BE WHITELISTED FOR STORAGE
